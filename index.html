            <p>Hi there! My name is Gabriella Ang! 
                I am currently a student studying Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
                I have a passion for the intersection of computer science and biology/ healthcare, 
                particularly for how to use data science and machine learning to better people's lives.
                Outside of school and career, my hobbies include crochet, playing guitar and piano, and trying new foods.
                Feel free to take a look at some of my previous projects and experiences! </p>
